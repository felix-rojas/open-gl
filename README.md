# OPEN-GL

## Introduction

This is a repository I'll use for various tests using Open-GL to create cross-platform graphics executables.

## Folder structure

- [Build folder](./build/)
  This is where I point cmake to build
- [Source files](./src/)
  This is the source directory that cmake requests
- [Additional cmake configurations](./cmake/)
  For now, there's only the `./cmake/FindGLFW3.cmake` file which points to any installation of GLFW in Windows, Mac and Linux
- [Notes](./notes/)
  Additional notes regarding the installation process and what I have learned
